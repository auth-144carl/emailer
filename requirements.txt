# pip required packages file
# Processed by build.sh into a virtualenv in build/venv
# http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/requirements.html

# All packages must have sha1 hashes to avoid things like the rubygems hack
# TODO: pip 1.2.1 has something broken this this doesn't actually work at the moment!
# pip is run with --no-deps, so we must manually list dependencies (to ensure we checksum all packages)
# To get dependencies:
# virtualenv test_venv
# mkdir cache
# ./test_venv/bin/pip install --download-cache cache (package)
# Calculate sha256 with shasum -a 256 filename
